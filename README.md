# OpenMRS Allergy API Module
The Allergy API is a Java-based API that handles patient data in OpenMRS related to allergies. More specifically, the main motivations
behind this API are to easily add allergy objects to patients, to change certain aspects of allergy objects for a patient such as severity and allergens in an organized fashion
(through variables such as allergy ID), and to compare allergies with each other to see if they have similar properties or characteristics.


## Build
To build the module from source, clone this repo:

```
https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-allergyapi.git
```

Then navigate into the `openmrs-module-allergyapi` directory and compile the module using Maven:

```
cd openmrs-module-allergyapi && mvn clean install
```

:maple_leaf: Maven and Java 8 need to be installed to successfully build and run 
the tests. :maple_leaf:
