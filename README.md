About the Allergy API Module
===
The Allergy API is a Java-based API that handles patient data in OpenMRS related to allergies. More specifically, the main motivations
behind this API are to easily add allergy objects to patients, to change certain aspects of allergy objects for a patient such as severity and allergens in an organized fashion
(through variables such as allergy ID), and to compare allergies with each other to see if they have similar properties or characteristics.
